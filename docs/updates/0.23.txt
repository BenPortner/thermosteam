Thermosteam 0.22
================

0.23.3
------
New features:

* The :meth:`Stream.mix_from <thermosteam.Stream.mix_from>` can now mix empty 
  streams.
* Synonymns to all chemicals (e.g. IUPAC names, common name, formula) are 
  automatically added after copiling a :class:`~thermosteam.Chemicals` object.
* Creating a :class:`~thermosteam.Chemical` doesn't require an alphanumerical 
  ID (any string is valid).
* Better errors for material indexers (i.e. imol, imass, and ivol properties 
  of :class:`~thermosteam.Stream` objects).
