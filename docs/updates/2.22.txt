New features:

* :meth:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction.correct_atomic_balance` can now balance equations where the number of atoms balanced is greater than the number varied chemical coefficients.

* :class:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction` objects can now be imported directly from the thermosteam module (e.g. "from thermosteam import Reaction").
