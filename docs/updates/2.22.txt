Thermosteam 2.22
================

2.22.2
------

New features:

* :class:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction`, :class:`thermosteam.reaction.ParallelReaction`,
  and :class:`thermosteam.reaction.SeriesReaction` can now handle chemical reactions
  with phases changed. For example, Reaction('H2O,l -> H2,g + O2,g', reactant='H2O')
  will be able to react a MultiStream and add products (i.e. H2, O2) to the gas phase.
  

2.22.1
------

New features:

* :attr:`thermosteam.Stream.S` now returns absolute entropy instead of relative entropy.

* :meth:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction.correct_atomic_balance` can now balance equations where the number of atoms balanced is greater than the number varied chemical coefficients.

* :class:`thermosteam.reaction.Reaction` objects can now be imported directly from the thermosteam module (e.g. "from thermosteam import Reaction").
