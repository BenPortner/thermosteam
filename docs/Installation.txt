Installation
============

Get the latest version of Thermosteam from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thermosteam/>`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install thermosteam


To get the git version and install it, run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ git clone --depth 100 git://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam
   $ cd thermosteam
   $ pip install .

We use the `depth` option to clone only the last 100 commits. Thermosteam has a 
long history, so cloning the whole repository (without using the depth option)
may take over 30 min.


Common Issues
-------------

* **Cannot install/update Thermosteam:**

  If you are having trouble installing or updating Thermosteam, it may be due to dependency issues. You can bypass these using:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install --user --ignore-installed thermosteam

  You can make sure you install the right version by including the version number:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ pip install thermosteam==<version>
