ThermoSTEAM: BioSTEAM's Premier Thermodynamic Property Package
==============================================================

Key Features & Capabilities
---------------------------

* **Simple:** 
  Straight foward methods to estimate mixture properties and thermodynamic equilibrium with just a few lines of code.

* **Clear:**
  Chemical and phase data are clearly represented throughout every object using IPython's rich display.

* **Fast:**
  Smart use of cache and Numba Jit compiled functions allows thermodynamic equilibrium computations within hundreds of microseconds.

* **Flexible:**
  New thermodynamic models for estimating pure component properties can be implemented in just a few lines of code.

* **Extendable:**
  New methods for computing thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients and mixture properties can be easily integrated.
