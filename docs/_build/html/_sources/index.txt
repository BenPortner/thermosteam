Thermosteam: BioSTEAM's Premier Thermodynamic Property Package
==============================================================

Key Features & Capabilities
---------------------------

* **Simple** and straight foward estimation of mixture properties and thermodynamic equilibrium with just a few lines of code.

* **Clear** representation of chemical and phase data within every object using IPython's rich display system.

* **Fast** estimation of thermodynamic equilibrium within hundreds of microseconds through the smart use of cache and Numba Jit compiled functions.

* **Flexible** implemention of thermodynamic models for estimating pure component properties in just a few lines of code.

* **Extendable** framework that allows easy integration of new methods for computing thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients and mixture properties.
